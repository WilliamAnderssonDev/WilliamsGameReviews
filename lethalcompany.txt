Lethal Company - Scary Fun with Friends

Lethal Company is a multiplayer horror game where you and your friends explore eerie environments, collect scrap to reach the daily quota, and try to survive the terrifying creatures.
This game is best played with 3-4 friends. I played it with my friends one evening, and we had an amazing time. We got lost trying to sell items, panicked when the spaceship left without one of us, and screamed when a swarm of bees chased us—or when a mimic we thought was a friend ate us. That unpredictability is what makes this game so much fun!
Talking in-game is a must. It makes everything more intense and exciting. The game can be a bit tricky at first—figuring out where to go, how to avoid getting caught, or what to do next—but that’s part of the fun. Every chaotic moment just adds to the experience.
Verdict: Lethal Company is perfect for casual gamers who want a mix of scares and laughs. It’s chaotic, unpredictable, and a blast to play with friends. We’ll definitely play it again!

Rating: 6.5/10 – A unique and fun multiplayer experience.
